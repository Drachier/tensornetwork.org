## Representation of Continuous Functions

### Introduction

Consider a one-dimensional function $f(x)$ with $0 \leq x < 1$.
The variable $x$ can be expressed to high precision
as a *binary fraction*
\begin{equation}
x = 0.b_1b_2\cdots b_n = b_1/2 + b_2/2^2 + \ldots + b_n/2^n \ .
\end{equation}
described by bits $b_i = 0,1$. (For example, $1/3 \approx 0.010101$.)
This way of writing numbers is similar to the to the binary representation of integers, but with the numbers stepping through
a finely-spaced grid of spacing $1/2^n$ instead of steps of size 1.

Next we can write the values the function $f(x)$ takes on this grid as
$f(x) = f(0.b_1b_2\cdots b_n) = F^{b_1 b_2 \cdots b_n}$ so that the values of $f(x)$ have been repackaged into an $n$-index tensor $F$.

The last move is to approximate of $F$ as a tensor network, such as a [[matrix product state / tensor train|mps]]
network:
\begin{equation}
F^{b_1 b_2 \cdots b_n} = \sum_{\{\mathbf{\alpha}\}} A^{b_1}_{\alpha_1}
A^{b_2}_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2}
A^{b_3}_{\alpha_2 \alpha_3}
\cdots
A^{b_n}_{\alpha_{n-1}}
\end{equation}

Tensor networks of this class turn out to have very low rank (or bond dimension) for a wide class of 
functions $f(x)$ such as functions which are smooth or have periodic or self-similar structure.
For example, both the functions $f(x) = e^{i k x}$ and $f(x) = \delta(x-k)$
give MPS/TT ranks of exactly one (Kronecker product of vectors).

The idea of using tensor train (TT) this way is known as the "quantics tensor train" (QTT) (or "quantized tensor train") representation of a function.
It can be straightforwardly generalized to two-dimensional, three-dimensional, or higher-dimensional functions
by using a tensor train with two, three, or more open indices on each tensor.
